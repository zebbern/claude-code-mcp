# Cybersecurity MCPs: Enhancing Claude for Security Operations

These MCPs enable Claude to assist in cybersecurity tasks, including threat intelligence, vulnerability management, incident response, and security analysis.

## General Cybersecurity MCP Considerations

*   **Threat Intelligence Feeds**: MCPs can integrate with various threat intelligence platforms to provide Claude with real-time threat data.
*   **Vulnerability Databases**: Access to CVE databases and other vulnerability information for analysis.
*   **SIEM/SOAR Integration**: Potential for integration with Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) and Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) systems.
*   **Log Analysis**: Enable Claude to analyze security logs for anomalies and potential threats.
