# Everything MCP

The Everything MCP serves as a comprehensive reference and test server, demonstrating a wide range of capabilities within the Model Context Protocol. It includes various prompts, resources, and tools, making it an excellent starting point for understanding the breadth of what MCP can achieve and for testing new Claude Code integrations.

## Capabilities

*   **Diverse Toolset**: Exposes a variety of tools covering different functionalities (e.g., text manipulation, data retrieval, simple calculations).
*   **Resource Access**: Provides access to various types of resources, showcasing how Claude can interact with different data formats.
*   **Prompt Examples**: Includes numerous examples of prompts designed to interact with its tools and resources, serving as a guide for effective Claude Code usage.
*   **Testing Ground**: Ideal for developers to test their understanding of MCP and to validate Claude's ability to utilize different tools.

## Configuration

To add the Everything MCP, you typically use `npx` to run the official server. This server is often used for development and testing purposes.

```bash
claude mcp add everything-server --command npx --args -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-everything
```

### Example Configuration in `.mcp.json` (Project Scope)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "everything": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-everything"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage Examples

Once configured, Claude can use the Everything MCP to explore various functionalities.

### 1. Using a Simple Tool

Ask Claude to use a basic tool provided by the Everything MCP, for instance, a tool that reverses a string:

```
Using the `everything` server, reverse the string "Hello World".
```

Claude will invoke the appropriate tool and return the reversed string.

### 2. Accessing a Resource

Instruct Claude to access a sample resource, such as a predefined text snippet:

```
Read the content of the resource `@everything:text://sample-text`.
```

Claude will retrieve the content of the `sample-text` resource.

### 3. Exploring Capabilities

Ask Claude to list the capabilities of the `everything` server to understand what tools and resources are available:

```
What tools and resources are available on the `everything` MCP server?
```

Claude will provide a list of all exposed functionalities.

## Best Practices

*   **Exploration**: Use the Everything MCP to explore the syntax and capabilities of MCP in a controlled environment.
*   **Debugging**: It can be a valuable tool for debugging issues related to MCP server configuration or Claude's tool-use reasoning.
*   **Learning**: Study its source code and examples to understand how different MCP features are implemented.
