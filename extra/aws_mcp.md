# AWS MCPs: Managing AWS Resources with Claude Code

AWS MCPs allow Claude Code to interact with your Amazon Web Services (AWS) environment, enabling natural language control over cloud resources. This can significantly accelerate development, operations, and infrastructure management.

## Key Features:

*   **Resource Management**: Create, modify, and delete AWS resources (e.g., EC2 instances, S3 buckets, Lambda functions) through natural language commands.
*   **Configuration and Deployment**: Automate the configuration and deployment of applications and infrastructure on AWS.
*   **Monitoring and Troubleshooting**: Query logs, monitor resource health, and troubleshoot issues within your AWS environment.
*   **Security and Compliance**: Integrate with AWS IAM for secure access control and ensure compliance with organizational policies.

## Popular Implementations and Tools:

*   **`RafalWilinski/aws-mcp`**: A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables AI assistants like Claude to interact with your AWS environment. This allows for natural language control over AWS resources.
*   **`awslabs/mcp`**: AWS MCP Servers, designed to accelerate development with code analysis, documentation, and testing utilities. It integrates with AWS IAM for secure operations.
*   **Amazon Bedrock Integration**: Claude Code can connect directly to AWS Bedrock, allowing for secure and segregated interactions with AWS services.
*   **AWS SSO Integration**: Setting up Claude Code with AWS Single Sign-On (SSO) provides a more secure authentication method for accessing AWS resources.

## Use Cases:

*   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Define and manage your AWS infrastructure using natural language, allowing Claude Code to provision and de-provision resources.
*   **DevOps Automation**: Automate CI/CD pipelines, deploy applications, and manage infrastructure changes with Claude Code.
*   **Cloud Cost Optimization**: Query and analyze AWS spending, identify cost-saving opportunities, and implement optimizations.
*   **Security Auditing**: Use Claude Code to audit AWS configurations for security vulnerabilities and compliance issues.

## How to Use:

1.  **Set up an AWS MCP Server**: Deploy an AWS MCP server (e.g., `RafalWilinski/aws-mcp` or `awslabs/mcp`) in your AWS environment.
2.  **Configure Claude Code**: Add the AWS MCP server to your Claude Code configuration, providing the necessary credentials and endpoints.
3.  **Interact with AWS**: Use natural language commands within Claude Code to manage your AWS resources. For example:
    ```
    @aws create an s3 bucket named 'my-new-bucket'
    @aws list all ec2 instances in us-east-1
    @aws deploy the latest version of my-app to lambda
    ```

## Best Practices:

*   **Least Privilege**: Configure IAM roles and policies with the principle of least privilege, granting only the necessary permissions to the MCP server.
*   **Secure Credentials**: Store AWS credentials securely, preferably using AWS Secrets Manager or similar services.
*   **Monitoring and Logging**: Enable comprehensive logging and monitoring for your AWS MCP server to track its activities and identify any anomalies.
*   **Version Control**: Manage your AWS infrastructure as code using version control systems like Git, even when using Claude Code for automation.
*   **Testing**: Thoroughly test your Claude Code interactions with AWS in a non-production environment before applying them to production systems.
