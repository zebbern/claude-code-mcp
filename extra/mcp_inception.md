# `MCP-Inception`: Enabling Communication Between MCP Clients

`MCP-Inception` is a unique Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that facilitates communication between different MCP clients. This allows for complex, multi-agent workflows where one Claude Code instance (or another MCP client) can interact with and leverage the capabilities of another Claude Code instance or client.

## Key Features

*   **Client-to-Client Communication**: Enables MCP clients to communicate with each other through this MCP server.
*   **Multi-Agent Workflows**: Supports advanced scenarios where multiple AI agents can collaborate and share information.
*   **Orchestration**: Can be used to orchestrate complex tasks by chaining together actions performed by different clients.

## How it Works (Conceptual)

`MCP-Inception` acts as a relay or a bridge. When an MCP client sends a request to `MCP-Inception`, the server can then forward that request (or a modified version of it) to another MCP client, and relay the response back. This creates a powerful mechanism for inter-client communication.

## Use Cases

*   **Distributed AI Systems**: Build systems where different Claude Code instances specialize in different tasks and communicate via `MCP-Inception`.
*   **Complex Task Delegation**: Delegate sub-tasks to other Claude Code instances that might have access to different tools or contexts.
*   **Collaborative Development**: Enable multiple developers using Claude Code to collaborate on a single project more seamlessly.
*   **Agent Swarms**: Create a network of AI agents that can coordinate and execute highly complex, multi-step processes.

## Installation and Usage

Specific installation and usage details for `MCP-Inception` would depend on its implementation. However, it would typically involve running the `MCP-Inception` server and then configuring your Claude Code instances (or other MCP clients) to connect to it.
