# `mcp-remote`: Proxy Tool for Remote MCP Servers

`mcp-remote` is a proxy tool that enables Claude Code to connect to and utilize remote Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. This is particularly useful for accessing MCP functionalities hosted on different machines or cloud environments, extending Claude's reach beyond local setups.

## Key Features

*   **Remote Connectivity**: Facilitates connections to MCP servers not running on the local machine.
*   **Proxy Functionality**: Acts as an intermediary, forwarding requests and responses between Claude Code and remote MCPs.
*   **Enhanced Flexibility**: Allows for distributed MCP architectures and access to specialized cloud-based services.

## How it Works (Conceptual)

`mcp-remote` would typically run locally and act as a bridge. When Claude Code attempts to connect to a remote MCP server, it would instead connect to `mcp-remote`. `mcp-remote` then handles the network communication to the actual remote MCP server, ensuring that the data is correctly transmitted and received. This can involve handling network protocols, authentication, and data formatting.

## Use Cases

*   **Accessing Cloud-Hosted MCPs**: Connect to MCP servers running on cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure.
*   **Distributed Development Environments**: Utilize MCPs hosted on remote development servers or shared resources.
*   **Security and Isolation**: Access sensitive MCPs that are isolated in secure network environments.
*   **Scalability**: Leverage the scalability of cloud infrastructure for computationally intensive MCP operations.

## Installation and Usage

Specific installation and usage details for `mcp-remote` would depend on its implementation. However, it would typically involve installing the `mcp-remote` tool and then configuring Claude Code to use it as a proxy for specific remote MCP servers.
