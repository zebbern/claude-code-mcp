# Social Media MCPs: Automating Content Creation

This section explores how Claude Code can be integrated with social media platforms, primarily through automation tools like Zapier, to streamline content creation and management.

## Zapier Integration for AI-Generated Social Media Posts

**Description**: This integration automates the creation of Facebook page posts using Anthropic (Claude). When a new row is added to a Google Sheets spreadsheet, Claude generates a captivating post based on the provided data, which is then automatically published on the Facebook page.

**Use Cases**:
*   Automated content generation for social media marketing.
*   Streamlining social media management for businesses and individuals.
*   Creating engaging posts without manual effort.

**How it Works**:
1.  **Trigger**: A new row is added to a Google Sheets spreadsheet.
2.  **Action**: A conversation is initiated with Claude to craft a post based on the spreadsheet data.
3.  **Publish**: The generated post is automatically published on the Facebook page.

**Benefits**:
*   Saves time and effort in social media content creation.
*   Ensures consistent posting schedules.
*   Leverages Claude's generative capabilities for high-quality content.

## GitHub Integration for Social Media Automation

**Description**: This involves using Claude Code with GitHub to automate social media tasks, potentially through custom scripts or workflows that interact with social media APIs.

**Use Cases**:
*   Automated posting of content from code repositories (e.g., new releases, blog posts).
*   Managing social media campaigns directly from a development environment.
*   Version control for social media content.

**How it Works**:
*   Custom scripts or GitHub Actions trigger Claude Code to generate social media content based on repository events or data.
*   The generated content is then pushed to social media platforms via their respective APIs.

**Benefits**:
*   Integrates social media management into existing development workflows.
*   Enables programmatic control over social media presence.
*   Facilitates collaboration on social media content within development teams.
