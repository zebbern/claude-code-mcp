# `Claude Enhancements`: Modular Utility Servers for Claude

`Claude Enhancements` is a collection of modular utility MCP servers designed to extend Claude Code's capabilities with various functionalities. These enhancements are lightweight, configurable, and integrate seamlessly with Claude through a JSON interface, allowing for a tailored and efficient AI assistant experience.

## Key Features

*   **Modular Utilities**: Provides a set of distinct, specialized tools that can be enabled or disabled as needed.
*   **Configurable JSON Interface**: Allows for easy customization and setup of each utility through a simple JSON configuration.
*   **Lightweight**: Designed to be efficient and not impose significant overhead on Claude Code.
*   **Examples of Utilities**: Includes functionalities like greeting users, counting files, saving conversations, and managing context.

## How it Works (Conceptual)

`Claude Enhancements` likely operates as a suite of small, independent MCP servers, each exposing a specific tool. Claude Code would connect to these individual servers, and based on the user's prompt, invoke the relevant tool. The JSON configuration would define how these tools are exposed and any parameters they might require.

## Use Cases

*   **Personalized Interactions**: Customize Claude's responses, such as greetings or conversational nuances.
*   **Productivity Boosters**: Add quick utilities like file counting or conversation logging to streamline daily tasks.
*   **Context Management**: Implement advanced context handling mechanisms beyond the default `CLAUDE.md` files.
*   **Rapid Prototyping**: Quickly add new, small functionalities to Claude without building a full-fledged MCP server.

## Installation and Usage

Specific installation and usage details for `Claude Enhancements` would depend on its implementation. However, it would typically involve running the individual utility servers and configuring Claude Code to recognize them through their JSON interfaces.
