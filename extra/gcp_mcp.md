# GCP MCPs: Managing Google Cloud Resources with Claude Code

GCP MCPs enable Claude Code to interact with your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) environment, providing natural language control over GCP services. This integration simplifies cloud operations, development, and management within the Google Cloud ecosystem.

## Key Features:

*   **Resource Orchestration**: Create, configure, and manage GCP resources (e.g., Compute Engine instances, Cloud Storage buckets, Cloud Functions) using natural language commands.
*   **Deployment Automation**: Automate the deployment of applications and infrastructure to GCP.
*   **Monitoring and Logging**: Query Cloud Monitoring logs, check resource health, and diagnose issues within your GCP environment.
*   **Security and Access Control**: Integrate with Google Cloud IAM for secure authentication and authorization.

## Popular Implementations and Tools:

*   **Google Vertex AI Integration**: Configure Claude Code through Google Vertex AI for enhanced AI capabilities and seamless integration with GCP services.
*   **MCP Toolbox for Databases**: This tool (formerly Gen AI Toolbox for Databases) now supports Model Context Protocol (MCP), enabling any MCP-compatible AI assistant (including Claude Code) to interact with Google Cloud Databases.
*   **GitHub MCP Server Integration**: Accelerate ADK development with Claude Code and GitHub MCP Server, allowing Claude Code to leverage the GitHub MCP server to read documentation and examples directly from your specified repositories.

## Use Cases:

*   **Cloud Resource Management**: Manage your GCP infrastructure, including virtual networks, storage, and serverless functions, through natural language interactions.
*   **DevOps Workflows**: Automate CI/CD processes, deploy microservices, and manage containerized applications on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).
*   **Data Management**: Interact with Google Cloud Databases, BigQuery, and other data services for data analysis and manipulation.
*   **Security and Compliance**: Enforce security policies, manage access controls, and audit GCP configurations for compliance.

## How to Use:

1.  **Set up a GCP MCP Server**: While dedicated GCP MCP servers might be less common than AWS/Azure, integrations often leverage existing GCP services or custom-built solutions. For database interactions, the MCP Toolbox for Databases is a key component.
2.  **Configure Claude Code**: Add the GCP integration to your Claude Code configuration, providing the necessary credentials and endpoints. For Vertex AI, follow the specific setup instructions.
3.  **Interact with GCP**: Use natural language commands within Claude Code to manage your GCP resources. For example:
    ```
    @gcp create a cloud storage bucket named 'my-gcp-bucket'
    @gcp list all compute instances in us-central1
    @gcp deploy the 'my-api' to Cloud Functions
    ```

## Best Practices:

*   **Identity and Access Management**: Utilize Google Cloud IAM for robust authentication and authorization, following the principle of least privilege.
*   **Secure Credentials**: Store GCP credentials securely, leveraging Google Secret Manager or service accounts.
*   **Monitoring and Logging**: Implement comprehensive monitoring and logging using Cloud Monitoring and Cloud Logging to track MCP server activities and GCP resource performance.
*   **Infrastructure as Code**: Define your GCP infrastructure using tools like Terraform or Cloud Deployment Manager, even when automating with Claude Code.
*   **Testing**: Thoroughly test your Claude Code interactions with GCP in non-production environments to prevent unintended changes in production.
