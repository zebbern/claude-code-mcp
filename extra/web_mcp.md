# `WebMCP`: Turning Any Website into an MCP Server

`WebMCP` is an innovative Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that allows you to turn any website into a source of context and tools for Claude Code. This powerful MCP enables Claude to interact with web content in a structured and customizable way, extending its capabilities beyond traditional web browsing.

## Key Features

*   **Website as Context**: Treat any website as a dynamic source of information for Claude.
*   **Customizable Tools**: Define specific tools and actions that Claude can perform on the website.
*   **Structured Interaction**: Provides a structured way for Claude to extract data, fill forms, or trigger actions on web pages.
*   **Dynamic Content Access**: Access and interpret dynamically loaded web content.

## How it Works (Conceptual)

`WebMCP` likely works by acting as a proxy or an interpreter between Claude Code and the target website. It would allow you to define rules or schemas that map elements or functionalities on a webpage to MCP tools. When Claude invokes a `WebMCP` tool, `WebMCP` would then interact with the website (e.g., by making HTTP requests, parsing HTML, or executing JavaScript) and return the results in a structured format that Claude can understand.

## Use Cases

*   **Automated Web Scraping**: Extract specific data from websites for analysis or integration.
*   **Web Form Automation**: Automatically fill out and submit web forms.
*   **Content Summarization**: Summarize articles or specific sections of web pages.
*   **Interactive Web Applications**: Enable Claude to interact with web-based tools or dashboards.
*   **Research and Information Gathering**: Systematically collect information from multiple web sources.

## Installation and Usage

Specific installation and usage details for `WebMCP` would depend on its implementation. However, it would typically involve running the `WebMCP` server and then configuring Claude Code to use it, likely by providing the URL of the target website and any defined tools.
