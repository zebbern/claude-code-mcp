# EverArt MCP (Archived)

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: This MCP server is archived and no longer maintained. For the latest information and actively maintained servers, please visit the [official MCP servers repository](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers).**

The EverArt MCP was designed to provide Claude Code with AI image generation capabilities. While archived, it represents an early integration of generative AI art into agentic workflows, allowing Claude to create or modify images based on textual prompts.

## Capabilities

*   **Image Generation**: Generate images from text descriptions.
*   **Image Modification**: Potentially modify existing images (depending on the specific implementation).
*   **Style Control**: Influence the artistic style of generated images.

## Configuration

As an archived MCP, specific configuration details may be outdated. Typically, an image generation MCP would require API keys for the underlying image generation service (e.g., DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion) and potentially model selection parameters.

## Usage Examples

### 1. Generating an Image from a Prompt

Ask Claude to generate an image based on a description:

```
Using the EverArt MCP, generate an image of "a futuristic city at sunset, cyberpunk style, with flying cars and neon lights."
```

### 2. Specifying Artistic Style

Instruct Claude to generate an image in a particular artistic style:

```
Using the EverArt MCP, create an image of "a serene forest with a hidden waterfall" in the style of a watercolor painting.
```

## Best Practices

*   **Detailed Prompts**: Provide highly descriptive prompts to guide the image generation process effectively.
*   **Iterative Refinement**: Generate multiple variations and refine prompts based on the results.
*   **Ethical Considerations**: Be mindful of ethical implications when generating images, especially concerning biases or harmful content.
