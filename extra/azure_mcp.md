# Azure MCPs: Managing Azure Resources with Claude Code

Azure MCPs enable Claude Code to interact with your Microsoft Azure environment, providing natural language control over Azure services. This integration streamlines cloud management, development, and operations within the Azure ecosystem.

## Key Features:

*   **Resource Provisioning**: Create, configure, and manage Azure resources (e.g., Virtual Machines, Azure Functions, Azure SQL Database) using natural language commands.
*   **Deployment Automation**: Automate the deployment of applications and infrastructure to Azure.
*   **Monitoring and Diagnostics**: Query Azure Monitor logs, check resource health, and diagnose issues within your Azure environment.
*   **Security and Access Control**: Integrate with Azure Active Directory (now Microsoft Entra ID) for secure authentication and authorization.

## Popular Implementations and Tools:

*   **`kalivaraprasad-gonapa/azure-mcp`**: A Model Context Protocol (MCP) implementation that enables Claude Desktop to interact with Azure services, allowing Claude to query and manage resources.
*   **Azure AI Foundry Integration**: Integrate Azure AI Foundry's Agent Service with Claude Desktop using MCP for powerful AI agent capabilities.
*   **Azure API Management**: Build Claude-Ready Entra ID-Protected MCP Servers with Azure API Management for secure and scalable MCP deployments.
*   **Azure CLI and Terraform Integration**: Use Claude Code with Azure CLI and Terraform for infrastructure as code (IaC) and deployment automation on Azure.

## Use Cases:

*   **Cloud Resource Management**: Manage your Azure infrastructure, including virtual networks, storage accounts, and web apps, through natural language interactions.
*   **DevOps Workflows**: Automate CI/CD processes, deploy microservices, and manage containerized applications on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).
*   **Cost Management**: Analyze Azure spending, identify underutilized resources, and optimize costs.
*   **Security Compliance**: Enforce security policies, manage access controls, and audit Azure configurations for compliance.

## How to Use:

1.  **Set up an Azure MCP Server**: Deploy an Azure MCP server (e.g., `kalivaraprasad-gonapa/azure-mcp`) in your Azure environment.
2.  **Configure Claude Code**: Add the Azure MCP server to your Claude Code configuration. Ensure you are authenticated with Azure (e.g., via Azure CLI or VS Code).
3.  **Interact with Azure**: Use natural language commands within Claude Code to manage your Azure resources. For example:
    ```
    @azure create a virtual machine named 'my-vm' with Ubuntu
    @azure list all web apps in resource group 'my-resource-group'
    @azure deploy the 'backend-service' to Azure Functions
    ```

## Best Practices:

*   **Identity and Access Management**: Utilize Azure Active Directory (Microsoft Entra ID) for robust authentication and authorization, following the principle of least privilege.
*   **Secure Credentials**: Store Azure credentials securely, leveraging Azure Key Vault or managed identities.
*   **Monitoring and Logging**: Implement comprehensive monitoring and logging using Azure Monitor and Azure Log Analytics to track MCP server activities and Azure resource performance.
*   **Infrastructure as Code**: Define your Azure infrastructure using tools like Terraform or Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates, even when automating with Claude Code.
*   **Testing**: Thoroughly test your Claude Code interactions with Azure in non-production environments to prevent unintended changes in production.
