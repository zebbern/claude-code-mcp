# `Windows Command Line MCP Server`: Bridging Claude and Windows Command Line

`Windows Command Line MCP Server` creates a secure bridge between Claude Code and your computer's command-line functionality specifically for Windows operating systems. This allows Claude to execute commands and interact with the Windows environment, extending its capabilities for system management and development tasks on Windows.

## Key Features

*   **Windows Command Execution**: Enables Claude to run commands in the Windows Command Prompt or PowerShell.
*   **Secure Bridge**: Provides a controlled and secure interface for interaction.
*   **System Management**: Allows Claude to perform various system-level tasks on Windows.

## How it Works (Conceptual)

This MCP server would likely act as an intermediary, receiving commands from Claude Code, executing them within the Windows command-line environment, and then returning the output back to Claude. Security measures would be crucial to ensure that only authorized commands are executed and that Claude operates within defined boundaries.

## Use Cases

*   **Automated Windows Tasks**: Automate routine tasks on Windows, such as file operations, software installations, or system configurations.
*   **Windows Development**: Assist with development workflows specific to the Windows environment.
*   **Troubleshooting Windows Systems**: Execute diagnostic commands and gather system information.

## Installation and Usage

Specific installation and usage details for `Windows Command Line MCP Server` would depend on its implementation. It would involve running the server on a Windows machine and configuring Claude Code to connect to it.
