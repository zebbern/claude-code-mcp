# `mcpx`: Dynamic, Reprogrammable MCP Server

`mcpx` is a powerful and dynamic Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that acts as a central hub for discovering and installing other MCP servers. It simplifies the process of extending Claude Code's capabilities by allowing you to find and integrate new tools without manual configuration.

## Key Features

*   **Dynamic Discovery**: Discover and install other MCP servers from `mcp.run`.
*   **Reprogrammable**: Its dynamic nature allows for flexible adaptation to various needs.
*   **Simplified Configuration**: Once installed via `mcpx`, other MCP servers appear in your MCP Client (like Claude Code) ready to use, requiring no additional configuration.
*   **Centralized Management**: Provides a single point of entry for managing a wide range of MCP functionalities.

## Installation and Usage

To use `mcpx`, you would typically install it and then use it to manage other MCPs. The exact installation method might vary, but it generally involves using `npx` or a similar package manager.

### Example Installation (Conceptual)

```bash
npx -y mcpx@latest install
```

Once `mcpx` is running, you can interact with it through Claude Code to discover and enable other MCPs. The specific commands would depend on the `mcpx` implementation, but it would likely involve a tool call to `mcpx`.

## Use Cases

*   **Rapid Prototyping**: Quickly integrate new tools and services into your Claude Code workflow.
*   **Experimentation**: Easily test different MCP servers without complex setup.
*   **Centralized Tool Management**: Manage all your Claude Code MCPs from a single interface.
*   **Dynamic Workflows**: Create highly adaptable workflows that can leverage a wide array of external tools on demand.
