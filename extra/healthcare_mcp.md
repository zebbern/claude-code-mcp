## General Healthcare MCP Considerations

*   **FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources)**: Many healthcare MCPs leverage FHIR for standardized data exchange. Look for MCPs that support FHIR for robust interoperability.
*   **Data Privacy and Security**: Always prioritize HIPAA compliance and secure data handling when working with healthcare data.
*   **Ethical AI in Healthcare**: Be mindful of the ethical implications of using AI in medical contexts.
