These MCPs enable Claude to assist in various aspects of gaming, from development and design to in-game interactions and analysis.

## General Gaming MCP Considerations

*   **Game Logic and AI**: Assist in generating game logic, character behaviors, or AI for NPCs.
*   **Player Support**: Provide in-game assistance, answer FAQs, or troubleshoot issues.
