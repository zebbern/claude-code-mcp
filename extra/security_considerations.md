# Security Considerations for Claude Code MCP Integrations

Integrating Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers with Claude Code significantly enhances its capabilities, but it also introduces critical security considerations. As MCP allows Claude to interact with your local environment, external services, and sensitive data, it is paramount to implement robust security practices to mitigate risks such as unauthorized access, data breaches, and prompt injection attacks.

## 1. Principle of Least Privilege

Always adhere to the principle of least privilege. Grant Claude Code and its associated MCP servers only the minimum necessary permissions required to perform their intended functions. Avoid granting broad or unnecessary access.

*   **Filesystem MCP**: Restrict access to specific directories or files. For example, instead of granting access to `/`, grant access only to `/project/src` and `/project/data`.
*   **API Keys/Tokens**: Configure API keys and tokens with the narrowest possible scopes. For instance, a GitHub PAT should only have `repo` access if Claude needs to manage repositories, not `admin:org`.

## 2. Secure Credential Management

Never hardcode sensitive credentials (API keys, database passwords, access tokens) directly into your `.mcp.json` files or `CLAUDE.md` files, especially if these files are part of a version-controlled repository.

*   **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables to store sensitive information. Claude Code can access environment variables, keeping your credentials out of your codebase.
    ```bash
    claude mcp add my-server --command npx --args -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-my-tool --env MY_API_KEY=$MY_API_KEY
    ```
*   **Secrets Management Systems**: For production environments, consider using dedicated secrets management systems (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, Kubernetes Secrets) to securely store and retrieve credentials.

## 3. Input Validation and Sanitization

When building custom MCP servers, rigorously validate and sanitize all inputs received from Claude Code before processing them. This prevents malicious inputs from being executed or causing unintended behavior.

*   **Prevent Path Traversal**: If your MCP server interacts with the file system, ensure that file paths are properly sanitized to prevent directory traversal attacks (e.g., `../../etc/passwd`).
*   **SQL Injection Prevention**: If your MCP server interacts with databases, use parameterized queries or ORMs to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Command Injection Prevention**: When executing shell commands, avoid concatenating user input directly into commands. Use safe command execution libraries or explicit argument passing.

## 4. Prompt Injection Awareness

Prompt injection is a significant risk where malicious inputs in a prompt can trick the LLM into overriding its instructions or performing unintended actions. While MCP servers add a layer of control, they can also be targets.

*   **Review Claude's Actions**: Always review Claude's proposed actions, especially those that involve modifying files, executing commands, or interacting with external services, before confirming.
*   **Confirmation Prompts**: Claude Code often prompts for confirmation before executing potentially sensitive actions. Do not blindly approve these prompts.
*   **Restrict Dangerous Tools**: Limit the tools and commands that Claude Code can execute, especially those with high impact (e.g., `rm -rf`, `git push --force`).

## 5. Regular Audits and Monitoring

Regularly audit the activities performed by Claude Code and its MCP integrations. Monitor logs for any suspicious or unexpected behavior.

*   **Log Review**: Review the logs generated by Claude Code and your MCP servers for any anomalies.
*   **Access Logs**: Monitor access logs for your integrated services (e.g., GitHub, databases) to detect unauthorized access attempts.
*   **Security Updates**: Keep Claude Code, MCP servers, and all underlying dependencies updated to patch known vulnerabilities.

## 6. Network Security

If your MCP servers are exposed over a network (e.g., HTTP or SSE servers), ensure proper network security measures are in place.

*   **Firewalls**: Restrict network access to your MCP servers using firewalls.
*   **HTTPS/TLS**: Always use HTTPS/TLS for encrypted communication if your MCP server is accessed over a network.
*   **Authentication**: Implement strong authentication mechanisms for network-accessible MCP servers.

## 7. User Confirmation for Sensitive Operations

For any operation that could have significant consequences (e.g., deleting files, pushing to production, making payments), ensure that Claude Code is configured to ask for explicit user confirmation. This acts as a final human safeguard.

By diligently applying these security considerations, you can harness the power of Claude Code and MCP integrations while maintaining a secure and controlled development environment.
