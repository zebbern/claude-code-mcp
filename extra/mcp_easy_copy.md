# `MCP Easy Copy`: Simplifying MCP Service Discovery

`MCP Easy Copy` is a utility MCP server designed to simplify the process of discovering and accessing available MCP services within your Claude Desktop configuration. It automatically reads Claude Desktop configuration files and presents all available MCP services in an easy-to-copy format, making it convenient for quick access and troubleshooting.

## Key Features

*   **Automated Service Discovery**: Automatically identifies and lists all configured MCP services.
*   **Easy-to-Copy Format**: Presents service details in a readily usable format, such as URLs or command snippets.
*   **Troubleshooting Aid**: Helps in diagnosing issues by providing a clear overview of active MCP services.
*   **User-Friendly**: Simplifies interaction with Claude Desktop's underlying MCP configuration.

## How it Works (Conceptual)

`MCP Easy Copy` acts as a query interface for Claude Desktop's internal MCP registry. When invoked, it would parse the relevant configuration files (e.g., `settings.json` or `mcp.json`) to extract information about all registered MCP servers. It then formats this information into a human-readable and easily copyable output, which Claude can then present to the user.

## Use Cases

*   **Quick Access to MCP URLs**: Easily retrieve the URLs for remote MCP servers without manually navigating through configuration files.
*   **Debugging Connectivity**: Verify that MCP servers are correctly registered and accessible.
*   **Sharing Configurations**: Quickly share details of active MCP services with teammates.
*   **Automating MCP Interactions**: Use the output to programmatically interact with specific MCP services.

## Installation and Usage

Specific installation and usage details for `MCP Easy Copy` would depend on its implementation. However, it would typically involve running the `MCP Easy Copy` server and then invoking it through Claude Code to get the list of services.
