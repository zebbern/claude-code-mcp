# `1MCP Agent`: Aggregating Multiple MCP Servers

`1MCP Agent` is an advanced MCP server designed to aggregate multiple MCP servers into a single, unified interface. This powerful tool reduces system resource usage and simplifies configuration management by providing a central proxy for all your MCP needs. It supports dynamic reloading and tag-based filtering capabilities for enhanced flexibility.

## Key Features

*   **Unified Interface**: Consolidates multiple MCP servers into one accessible endpoint.
*   **Resource Optimization**: Reduces the overhead of running numerous individual MCP servers.
*   **Simplified Configuration**: Centralizes the management of diverse MCP functionalities.
*   **Dynamic Reloading**: Allows for real-time updates to MCP configurations without restarting the agent.
*   **Tag-Based Filtering**: Enables granular control and selection of MCP tools based on defined tags.

## How it Works (Conceptual)

`1MCP Agent` acts as a smart proxy. Instead of Claude Code connecting directly to each individual MCP server, it connects only to `1MCP Agent`. `1MCP Agent` then intelligently routes Claude's requests to the appropriate underlying MCP server, processes the responses, and returns them to Claude. This abstraction layer simplifies Claude's interaction and optimizes resource usage.

## Use Cases

*   **Complex Workflows**: Orchestrate highly complex tasks that require interaction with a wide array of specialized MCPs.
*   **Resource Management**: Efficiently manage system resources by consolidating MCP server connections.
*   **Centralized Control**: Gain a single point of control for all your Claude Code MCP integrations.
*   **Dynamic Toolsets**: Create dynamic toolsets for Claude based on project requirements or user roles.
*   **Scalability**: Easily scale your MCP ecosystem by adding or removing underlying servers without reconfiguring Claude Code.

## Installation and Usage

Specific installation and usage details for `1MCP Agent` would depend on its implementation. However, it would typically involve running the `1MCP Agent` server and then configuring Claude Code to connect to this single agent, which then manages all other MCPs.
