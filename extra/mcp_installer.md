# `MCP Installer`: Dynamic MCP Server Installation

`MCP Installer` is an MCP server designed to dynamically install and configure additional MCP servers. This streamlines the process of extending Claude Code's capabilities by automating the setup of new tools and integrations.

## Key Features

*   **Dynamic Installation**: Installs and configures MCP servers on the fly.
*   **Automated Setup**: Handles package management, environment configuration, and automatic Claude Desktop setup without manual editing.
*   **Simplified Workflow**: Reduces the complexity of integrating new MCPs into your Claude Code environment.

## How it Works (Conceptual)

`MCP Installer` acts as an installation agent. When Claude requests a new MCP server, this MCP can fetch the necessary files (e.g., from npm, GitHub, or a local path), install dependencies, and configure Claude Code to recognize and use the new server. This eliminates the need for manual command-line operations.

## Use Cases

*   **Rapid Prototyping**: Quickly add and test new MCP functionalities.
*   **Automated Environment Setup**: Automate the setup of development environments with specific MCPs.
*   **On-Demand Tooling**: Install specialized tools only when they are needed for a particular task.
*   **Simplified Onboarding**: New team members can quickly get up and running with all necessary MCPs.

## Installation and Usage

Specific installation and usage details for `MCP Installer` would depend on its implementation. However, it would typically involve running the `MCP Installer` server and then instructing Claude to use it to install other MCPs.
