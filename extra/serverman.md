# `Serverman (Server Manager)`: Managing Claude's MCP Configuration

`Serverman` is an MCP server designed to manage Claude Code's configuration for other MCP servers. It provides a centralized way to control and organize the various MCP integrations within your Claude Code environment.

## Key Features

*   **Centralized Configuration Management**: Simplifies the process of adding, removing, and managing MCP server configurations for Claude Code.
*   **Streamlined Workflow**: Reduces the need for manual editing of configuration files, making it easier to maintain your MCP setup.
*   **Enhanced Control**: Offers a dedicated interface for overseeing your Claude Code's MCP ecosystem.

## How it Works (Conceptual)

`Serverman` acts as an intermediary, allowing you to interact with Claude's underlying MCP configuration through a structured interface. Instead of directly manipulating configuration files, you would send commands to `Serverman`, which then translates those commands into the necessary changes within Claude Code's MCP setup.

## Use Cases

*   **Automated Setup**: Automate the setup of complex MCP environments for new projects or team members.
*   **Configuration Auditing**: Easily review and audit the active MCP server configurations.
*   **Troubleshooting**: Quickly identify and resolve issues related to MCP server configurations.
*   **Dynamic Configuration**: Potentially enable dynamic changes to MCP configurations based on project context or other triggers.

## Installation and Usage

Specific installation and usage details for `Serverman` would depend on its implementation. However, it would typically involve running the `Serverman` MCP server and then interacting with it via Claude Code to manage other MCPs.
